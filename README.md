**ModelOps: Deploying Machine Learning Models to Production**

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by **SuperDataScience**, a global community dedicated to advancing the fields of **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**. 
* Develop a **FastAPI backend** (with a minimal frontend)
* **Containerize** your application with Docker
* Set up a **basic Continuous Integration / Continuous Develpment pipeline** using GitHub Actions
* **Deploy** the service to a cloud platform such as Hugging Face Spaces, Render, or AWS/GCP

## ðŸ“Š Dataset / Model

A provided pre-trained ML model artifact that already includes preprocessing and the trained estimator on a small dataset of car prices (in Great British Pounds). 
The focus is on serving, containerization, and deployment rather than model training.
